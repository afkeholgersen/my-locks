CMPT 300 Assignment 3

Implementations of the spinlock TAS, spinlock TTAS, mutex (exponential backoff), and queue lock are all safe for recursion, which is accounted

To compile: same as how the file was given. "make" to make the file, ./mylocks with all special values as indicated. (This is what i used
to test)
